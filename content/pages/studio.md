# Studio

One of the most important things for me when working from home is having the right tools. So, let's start with my main device - the computer.

## Computer

| Name       | Detail                       |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| OS         | Fedora 36 Linux 64-bit       |
| Proccessor | Ryzen 5 5600X 4.60Gz 6C-12T  |
| RAM        | 16GB 3600Mhz DDR4            |
| GPU        | GTX 1650s 12GB GDDR6         |
| Storage    | NVMe M.2 1TB Gen4x4          |

This computer may not have the latest specs, but it runs incredibly fast and smooth! It's perfect for web development, even for larger or heavier projects.

The 16GB of RAM also ensures that multitasking is a breeze!

### Support Device

With my trusty **Chromebook Duet 5** as my backup work companion, I've the freedom to work from anywhere.

Its powerful performance and long battery life ensure that productivity knows no bounds, whether I'm at a coffee shop or exploring remote locations.

I also have an Oppo Find X2 Neo Android, which comes in handy for as it is just better than an iphone in every way, it contains 16GB of RAM itself.

## Display

The triple monitor setup maximizes my development workflow. I can code on one half of my ultrawide monitor while previewing live on the other â€” no more <span class="text-xs"><Kbd>Alt</Kbd> + <Kbd>Tab</Kbd></span> necessary for faster, more efficient work! 

I usually keep a terminal session open on my top left screen, an usually either a file explorer or github desktop open on my top right.

I prefer to run a multi-workspace setup through my linux distro to swap between a code-space, research-space, and break-space, each altering the window setup between my three monitors to fit the situation, all just a hotkey away.
